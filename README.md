a module is a single file containing code, whereas a package is a collection of modules

# to compile and run in a single command

go run directory

# to print

import "fmt"

# dataTypes

bool
float32, float64
int, int16, int32, int64
rune
string
uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64

# same code

`var myVar = "text"`
`myVar := "text"`

# to initialise two or more variables

`var var1, var2 int = 1, 2`
meaning var1= 1, var2 = 2 and can also be wriiten as

`var1 var2:=1, 2`

# if statement and switch statement available
